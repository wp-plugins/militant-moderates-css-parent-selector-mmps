Adds support for the Parent Selector syntax in CSS Styles. Parent Selectors are used to apply the styling to a specific Parent element.

== Description ==
The right *Look and Feel* of your Theme can sometimes require that you modify the style of the **Parent** Element rather than that of the **Selected** Element. (The Selected Element is the last one matched by the CSS Selector.)

The **Militant Moderates CSS Parent Selector** (**MMPS**) plugin for WordPress lets you write CSS Selectors that use an extended syntax for CSS Styles. When this plugin is installed and enabled, the **Parent Selector** syntax will be properly recognized and executed.

== Installation ==
1. Extract the distribution ZIP file into the '/wp-content/plugins/' folder.
1. Verify the new folder named 'militant-moderates-css-parent-selector-mmps' is created and populated.
1. Activate the 'Militant Moderates CSS Parent Selector' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I can't make the Parent Selector Style work =
Double-check that the **Militant Moderates CSS Parent Selector** plugin is activated using the Plugins menu in WordPress. If it is properly enabled, try testing your Style without the exclamation mark '!' modifier. Make sure the Style works and is applied to the Child element. Once you have made sure the Selector and Style rules work then put the '!' back into the Selector and try again.
